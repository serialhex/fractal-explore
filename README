ok, so this is my _first_ programming project i've done without following a
tutorial or some such.  so it's probably not as efficent or cool or bug-free as
it could be, but it's my freaking first program so lighten up already!!!

this program allows you to explore the mandelbrot set, which takes a bit of time
to render on my P4 3.0Ghz machine... so all you spiffy people with your sporty
multi-core procs and just kiss my broke ...you know what...  dont worry if the
window dosnt just pop up, it takes a while.  treat it like a little retarted kid.
i mean... it kind of is (and if you dont like me saying that it's MY little
retarted kid were talking about here!!)

anyway, interacting with it is fairly simple, just open it up, use the arrow
keys to move around and the + and - keys to zoom in & out respectivly.

there are plans for switching between the mandelbrot set & the corresponding
julia set (using the center of the window).  also the ability to write out the
current fractal image.  that shouldnt be too hard but it's like 2am and i need
some sleep before i pass out on the keyboard!

oh, some tech requirements for running from source:
  i used ruby 1.9.2p136 (2010-12-25) [i386-mingw32] and no i didnt type that :P
though it should probably work with earlier versions if you change the
relative_require statements in main.rb
  this uses both gosu and texplay, so go get them & be happy (gem install xxx)

i should have a windows executable up here soon...?  mabye in the morning...
oh wait it is morning!! :/

anyway, have fun and take care!
